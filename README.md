## ✨ Features

- Performs basic operations: **Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division**
- Uses **Scanner** class to read user input from the console
- Built with **methods** for each operation to keep the code modular and clean
- **Loop** structure allows multiple calculations until the user decides to exit
- Handles invalid input and **division-by-zero** safely
